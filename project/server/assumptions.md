Assumptions:

In test_auth_login
    * I could assume that the first user who login will have "u_id: 00001" and "token: 1", the second user will have "u_id: 00002" and "token: 2" and so on. 

In auth_login
    * We could help user save email and password on local, so that they don't need to type in email and password agian and again.

In test_auth_register
    * I could assume that the first user who register will have "u_id: 00001" and "token: 1", the       second user will have "u_id: 00002" and "token: 2" and so on.

In auth_password_request
    * We should still have a function that generate a serious of random security code, and set it's valid period to 1 min.
    
In channel_details
    * We need to set a function for set up the name of channel, or we couldn't get a return "name" from the function channel_details

In channel_messages
    * we need a function that could count the total number of messages. Now, I assume that the total number of messages are 150

In channel_invite
    * u_id is the id who is invited
