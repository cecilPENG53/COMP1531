Since the 4 group members were unioned in the week2 tute, we form a chat group that night to keep in touch with team members.
Jankie, Tim ,Jeff and Daniel.

We have our first group meeting Sunday , week2, briefly talked about the project and trying to make every member in the group
to understand what are we going to do in the following 9 weeks. Here's the outcomes of this meeting:

* we learnt about each other's programming skills and styles and favorite languages. And we decide to meet every Thursday noon and Sunday afternoon to talk about the 
process.
* Each of us create a branch nnamed by our name and work on our own branchs.
* we decided to divide the 32 test functions into 4 groups which means ecah one of us took 8 functions to test. 
* Jankie took auth_login, auth_logout, auth_register, auth_passwordreset_request, auth_passwordreset_reset, channel_invite, channel_details, channel_messages.
