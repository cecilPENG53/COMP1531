Teamwork
======

Our group have regular meetings 3 times a week : on Wednesday, Thursday(lab) and  Sunday, because we seperated the work in group of two, each group is mainly focusing on the code problems between group members. When someone came across difficulties and unknown problems, it's more easier to discuss in groups rather then individually google it.

A group meeting directly helps members to write and debug code. In a sufficent and elegant way.

Each meeting usually last at least 90 minutes, and even up to 4 hours once.

When trying to work with the frontend, at the very beginning, all the test are failed because we had problems with every return type, and Jeff, the one who test it ask 
us all to group and fix our response part, then we put it into the frontend and keep tracking the code to ensure they work.

Some changes should be made to fit the customer feedback, so all the tests should also be changed a bit to ensure to code to work. When running the final tests, there 
were still some test not fixed, so Jef fixed it up and make it work.

We also having a lot of problems with uploading photos, this one troubles Tim a lot, and we were trying to help but failed. Actually a lot of the groups all have trouble
in it, we went to all the labs and some help sessions together, and it was a long queue. However the tutor there was unable to fix our problem. The problem was fixed in 
the last day of due date when we meet up together with the help of some reply in piazza.

When we are having meetings, usually one person sitting in front of the pc and writing code, with his partner sitting around talking about the code aim and code style, we would have discussions about why this function are used instead of others, and when someone came across problems, his partner can tell him the expected answer and his opinion about this.

At the final stage, the group will get together, before exchange their code, explain to their teammates how every functions work and what to remember, especially the abilitly they have achieved and not yet achieved.
